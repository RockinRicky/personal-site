<h2>About</h2>
<p><strong>Ricky's House</strong> is my website that includes links to some of my favorite things I have coded. From games going against AI to tools that can help you in your daily life. All of the tools and games and this website in general was coded. This website was coded using HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and the apps were created using JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Josiah H.</strong> (me) was born on 2010. I live in Western part of Oregon. I started coding in 2022 using block code and have loved it ever since. Today, I use text code. Besides coding I enjoy fireworks, movies/shows, biking, ETC.</p>

<h3>About Ricky</h3>
<p>Your probably (or not if you've known me for a long time) wondering, 'Who is Ricky?' Well, I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>Ricky was created on April 25, 2023. Ricky is an AI Assistant that can help you and bring you good company. From when he was created to now, there has been a lot of changes to make him the best creation I've ever made. I've spent hours everyday at some periods of time just working on this intelligent bot. So far, the newest app/website he has been in is Assistant, Ricky. That has so far had 9 updates since launch. He can create poems, biographies, story ideas, play video games with you, chat and remeber your name, creates chatbots, does math, searches websites and even can make decisions for you. I'm really glad Ricky has been coded for so long. I've gotten a lot of support from my classmates, teachers and even other coders. I named this website Ricky's House because half of the tools are literally Ricky. Thanks for the support and visiting Ricky's House!</p>
