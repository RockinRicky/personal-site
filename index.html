        <h3>About Ricky</h3>
        <p>You are probably wondering, 'Who is Ricky?' Well, I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>Ricky was created on April 25, 2023. Ricky is an AI Assistant that can help you and bring you good company.
            From when he was created to now, there has been a lot of changes to make him the best creation I've ever
            made. I've spent hours everyday at some periods of time just working on this intelligent bot. So far, the
            newest app/website he has been in is Assistant, Ricky. That has so far had 9 updates since launch. He can
            create poems, biographies, story ideas, play video games with you, chat and remeber your name, creates
            chatbots, does math, searches websites and even can make decisions for you. I'm really glad Ricky has been
            coded for so long. I've gotten a lot of support from my classmates, teachers and even other coders. I named
            this website Ricky's House because half of the tools are literally Ricky. Thanks for the support and
            visiting Ricky's House!</p>
